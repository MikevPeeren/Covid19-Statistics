# About the data

The data is sourced from Johns Hopkins CSSE.

## It changes rapidly

This data changes rapidly, so what’s shown may be out of date. Information about reported cases is also available on the World Health Organization site.

## It doesn’t include all cases

Confirmed cases aren’t all cases. They only include people who tested positive. Testing rules and availability vary by country.
